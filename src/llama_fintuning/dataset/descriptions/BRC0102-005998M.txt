* **Number of Threads:** It's impossible to determine the exact number of threads used in the creation of the blanket and sweater from this image.  The thickness or gauge also cannot be ascertained visually. However, the overall appearance suggests a medium weight yarn.

* **Stitch Types:** The blanket and sweater appear to utilize primarily post stitches, likely half-double crochet post stitches worked in a specific pattern to create the textured, raised ridges.  These ridges run vertically in the blanket.  The sweater appears to utilize the same stitch but it is hard to determine the direction from this picture. It's also possible that a combination of other basic stitches (such as single crochet or chain stitches) are used for the foundation or edging, but this cannot be confirmed from the image provided. The consistent texture suggests a regular repeating pattern throughout both pieces.

* **Yarn Color:**  Both the blanket and sweater are worked in a solid, bright orange-red yarn. There is no visible variation in color or gradient.

* **Knit vs. Crochet Distinction:** The items are definitely crocheted, not knitted. This is evident in the visible loops and the distinct texture created by the post stitches. Knit fabric tends to have a "V" shaped pattern, while crochet has more noticeable loops and a raised, more textured surface, especially with post stitches which are unique to crochet.  The structure and definition of the stitches in the blanket and sweater align perfectly with crochet techniques.

* **Number of Rows:**  It is impossible to count the exact number of rows in either the sweater or blanket from the provided image.  The blanket appears to be substantially longer than the sweater, implying a greater number of rows, given consistent yarn weight and hook size.  No variations in row patterns are apparent, suggesting a uniform stitch pattern from beginning to end of each piece.
